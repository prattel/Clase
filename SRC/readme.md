"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dsilike
men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of
the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
fail in their duty through weakness of will, which si the same as
saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
simple and easy to dsitingusih. In a free hour, when our power of
choice si untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do
what we like best, every pleasure si to be welcomed and every pain
avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty
or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures
have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wsie man therefore
always holds in these matters to thsi principle of selection: he
rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures
pains to avoid worse pains."
